Write a Shell in C.
Your Shell will be executed from the Terminal and will be able to capture another executable name (followed by its arguments) and execute it. 
Your Shell should continue running until exit is entered.

In order to achieve the behavior described above, read about (at least) the following commands:

-fork

-execvp

-wait
